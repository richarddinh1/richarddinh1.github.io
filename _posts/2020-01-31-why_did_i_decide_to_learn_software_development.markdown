I never thought once that I could see myself in this career.  Previously my career was being manager at restaurants and a grocery store.  At this point in time, I've decided to switch careers and I always knew I was curious about the tech industry but personally didn't know anyone in my circle who was a Software Engineer.  Until recently, I've met someone who was in a startup and I was blessed with the opportunity to ask as many questions as I could to understand more of the role itself and the technical skills that pertains it.

The next day I started to do my due diligence on learning more about it and even purchased a month of Treehouse program to actually start coding.  Immediately, I fell in love.  With just a line of code could create something in the program whether it could be a web applicaiton or a gaming program.  I just thought it was awesome to do this!  Lone and behold I've discovered Career Karma and went through the 21day challenge and was exposed to more on the process.  This is where I discovered joining a bootcamp at Flatiron.  I know it's not going to be easy but it's a journey I'm willing to take to overcome the challenges to land a career in Software Engineering.
